                  Most business owners know the frustration of spending more
                  time than they want or should on non-revenue-generating
                  activities. From payroll and human resource management to
                  benefits and compensation, entrepreneurs can spend up to 40
                  percent of their precious day engaged in these necessary but
                  time-sucking tasks.
